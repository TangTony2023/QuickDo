# QuickDo Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 17.Jul.2025

## 1. Data Collection and Usage  

QuickDo **does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data**. The app operates entirely offline and respects user privacy by design:  

- **Local Data Storage**:  
  All data (shortcuts, categories, settings) is stored exclusively in three local files:  
  - `categories.json` (category definitions)  
  - `settings.json` (user preferences)  
  - `todolist.json` (user's event)  
    These files remain on the user’s device and are never uploaded to external servers.  

- **No Telemetry or Analytics**:  
  The app does not track usage statistics, device information, or user behavior.  

- **No Account Requirements**:  
  QuickDo requires no login, authentication, or cloud synchronization.  

## 2. Permissions

QuickLauncher requests the following Windows capabilities solely for core functionality:  

| **Capability** | **Purpose**                                                  | **Data Access**                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `runFullTrust` | Launch applications via shortcuts (Win32 process interaction) | Only accesses paths explicitly provided by the user |

**Note:** These permissions are disabled by default and require explicit user action.  

## 3. Security

- **File Integrity**:  
  Configuration files (`categories.json`, `settings.json`, `todolist.json`) are stored in the app’s local installation directory with standard Windows file permissions.  
- **No Encryption**:  
  As no sensitive data is stored, encryption is not applied to local files.  

## 4. Third-Party Services

QuickDo does not integrate with any third-party APIs, libraries, or services that could compromise privacy.  

## 5. Children’s Privacy  

The app is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect data from them.  

## 6. Changes to This Policy  

Users will be notified via the Microsoft Store listing if this policy is updated.
